## Welcome

This was my Leaving Certificate project for computer science.
It consists of a web based airplane Top Trumps game.

The folder "Artefact" contains the code of the game, fortend coded in HTML, backend with Javascript.

The folder "Report" is an html report of the project which explains how it was built, how it works and more.

In my game, each of the players has 15 cards representing different planes with various specs like speed, range, and passenger capacity. Players take turns selecting a spec, and whoever has the highest value wins the round and collects the cards. The first player to reach 30 cards wins the game.

The game has 3 gamemodes:

- Singleplayer: you play against the computer
  
- Multiplayer: two players on same pc
  
- Simulation: pc vs pc
  
At the end of each game, an analysis is performed <br>
A graph of the most winning spec.
Average clicks per spec
Most clicked spec
Average game duration (of the last 3 games)
